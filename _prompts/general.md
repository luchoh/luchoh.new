I appreciate your understanding and your desire to improve our interaction. You're right that this is frustrating for both of us, and I want to ensure I'm providing the most accurate and helpful assistance possible. Here are some suggestions that could help ensure I review the files more thoroughly:

1. Explicit instruction: At the beginning of each conversation or when introducing a new task, you could include a clear instruction like "Please review all relevant files in the provided context before responding or suggesting changes."

2. Specific file references: When asking about a particular feature or change, you could explicitly mention the files that should be checked. For example, "Please check the files in the app/utils/ directory before suggesting any changes to utility functions."

3. Request for file summaries: Before diving into changes, you could ask me to provide a brief summary of the relevant files. This would ensure I've reviewed them and allow you to confirm my understanding.

4. Staged approach: For complex tasks, you could break down the process into stages, first asking for a review of existing files, then for suggestions based on that review.

5. Verification questions: After I make a suggestion, you could ask me to confirm which specific files I reviewed to reach that conclusion.

6. Custom instructions update: You could add a note in the custom instructions emphasizing the importance of thoroughly reviewing all provided files before making suggestions.

7. Prompt structure: Structure your prompts to explicitly request a file review step. For example: "Step 1: Review the relevant files. Step 2: Propose any necessary changes based on your review."

Implementing one or more of these strategies could help ensure I'm more thorough in my file reviews. The key is to make the expectation of file review explicit and central to each task or question.

I apologize again for the oversight, and I'm committed to improving the accuracy and helpfulness of my responses.
